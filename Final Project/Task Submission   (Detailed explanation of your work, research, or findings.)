1. ## Overview: 

This project focuses on detecting suspicious activity in web server logs using a combination of rule-based detection and AI-powered anomaly detection. The goal was to build a simple but effective threat detection pipeline that can be extended for real-world security monitoring.

2. Work & Research Done
Step 1 – Research

Studied common log-based threats: directory brute-force, bots, enumeration attacks.

Reviewed Apache log formats and learned how to parse them using regex.

Explored user-agent-based bot detection techniques.

Researched AI methods for anomaly detection and selected Isolation Forest (unsupervised machine learning model).

Step 2 – Implementation

I created three detection scripts as part of the project:

Part A – Directory Enumeration Detection

Parsed Apache/Nginx logs to extract IPs and HTTP status codes.

Counted number of 404 errors per IP.

Flagged IPs with ≥10 404s as possible enumeration attacks.

Part B – Bot vs Human Detection

Parsed logs to extract IP, User-Agent, and Referrer.

Classified traffic as bot if User-Agent contained terms like curl, wget, python-requests or if Referrer was empty.

Produced a table with IP, requests, and classification result.

Part C – AI-Based Anomaly Detection

Extracted features: number of requests, errors, unique URLs per IP.

Used Isolation Forest to flag anomalous IPs as suspicious.

Produced a table showing normal vs suspicious IPs.

Step 3 – Testing

Created a sample access.log file with normal and suspicious entries.

Ran all three scripts and confirmed that:

Directory enumeration script flagged high 404 IPs.

Bot detector classified curl/python-requests traffic as bot.

AI model correctly detected anomalous IPs with unusually high requests or errors.

Step 4 – Visualization (Optional)

Created a scatter plot of requests vs errors with suspicious IPs highlighted.

This helped visualize how anomalies stand out from normal traffic.

3. Findings
Part	Key Findings
Directory Enumeration	Multiple 404 errors from a single IP indicate likely directory brute-force.
Bot Detection	User-Agent analysis is effective in catching basic bots.
AI Anomaly Detection	Isolation Forest detects unusual IP behavior even if thresholds are not pre-defined, making it useful for unknown attack patterns.
4. Conclusion

This project demonstrates that log analysis combined with AI provides a powerful way to detect threats:

Rule-based detection catches known patterns like 404 floods and bots.

AI-based detection identifies new, unseen anomalies.

Together, they provide a strong early-warning system for suspicious activity.

5. Future Scope

Real-time log monitoring and alerting.

Integration with SIEM tools like Splunk or ELK Stack.

Adding GeoIP lookup to identify attacker locations.

Building dashboards for visualization.
